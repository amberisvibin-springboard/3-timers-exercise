# Assessment 1 - Meme Generator

## Projects & Exercises 

The assessment will take the form of **a web-based meme generator:** you'll use **everything you've learned in Web Fundamentals and DOM Manipulation** to create a web application for generating dank memes

In this unit, you'll be assessed on the skills you've been learning recently. You'll create a simple app to generate spicy memes from any input image and text you choose. Who knows, maybe the next Grumpy Cat of Bad Luck Brian will come out of your generator. 

The purpose of this assessment is not just to internalize the material, **but to give you a benchmark so you know how you are doing in the course.** It is also intended to spark a conversation with your mentor on your strengths and areas of growth, that will help you understand what to focus on in your job search. **Be sure to mention how long the assessment took when you talk to your mentor.**

**Please keep track of the hours you spend on the assessment in [this timesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yuytLlWDWLt3vuK3Q41IwDMvDnDCgJOS6KxutochOeI/copy).** Most students complete these assessments within 15 hours.  If you find yourself struggling to complete the assessment, **and you put in at least 25 hours of work,** you have the option to submit the work you have done and continue with the course. **If you do this, you will need to spend your next mentor session or sessions going over the steps it would have taken to complete the assessment. Please include this timesheet in your final submission.**

Assessments are meant to be completed independently, without consulting with your mentor, TA, or online student community. **Please refrain from any discussions on Slack regarding this assessment until you have completed it.**

You are welcome to complete it over the course of several days—it does not need to be finished in one sitting. When you’ve finished, you’ll save your assessment on **Google Drive** and submit your project here below. **You will have many assessments in this course, but the meme generator is the only one you will submit through Google Drive.**  Be sure that the link is correct and your assessment is totally finished, as you can only submit once. Your mentor will review your assessment and offer you feedback on how you did!
